                WHAT IS TYPESCRIPT?
            </h2>
            <p>
                    TypeScript is a language that adds additional features to Javascript, improving the quality 
                and legibility of your code. As the name suggests, you are meant to heavily use types throughout 
                your code which helps you catch minor errors. Specifically it is a superset of JavaScript, meaning 
                that any legal javascript code is also legal typescript code. However, this doesnâ€™t work the other 
                way around since TypeScript is a typed superset and adds additional rules to the JavaScript syntax. 
                TypeScript is both dynamically and statically typed. One of the most prominent aspects of TypeScript is 
                the ability to do static type checking. Static type checking basically analyzes the code to hint at 
                potential errors without having to run the program. With these features, TypeScript can be viewed as 
                more of a development tool than another coding language. If it spots an error, it will send a message 
                on the terminal similar to how the javac compiler does.

            <h2 class="heading">Downloading TypeScript</h2>
            <p>
                Prerequisites: node.js and npm <br>
                Global download: npm install -g typescript <br>
                Project download: npm install typescript --save-dev
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading">Using TypeScript</h2>
            <p>
                To compile a TypeScript file (ending in .ts), run: <br>
                (npx) tsc filename.ts <br>
                TS also comes with many flags and configurations in order to make the programming experience better and more individually tailored.
                One feature of default TS is that even though the code may have errors, it will still compile into a JS file.
                To stop this, you can use the --noEmitOnError flag after the compile command.
                To see more configs, run: <br>
                (npx) tsc --init <br>
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading">Getting Up to Speed With JavaScript</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a commonly used web development language for dynamic websites. 
                However, there are some features of JavaScript that may lead to confusion or potentially buggy code. 
                For example, JS variables are dynamic, meaning they can be reassigned to any type, like Python variables. 
                However, since JS is relatively lax about operations and functions, this can lead to confusion.
                Also, although JS has classes and some object-oriented programming paradigms, it lacks things like interfaces or generics, which can be useful.
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading">Features of TypeScript</h2>
            <p>
                Instead of dynamic typing like in JS, TS is strongly typed, but will still infer types based on initialization.
                Once a variable is set to one type, it cannot be changed afterwards.
                The syntax for variables and types is: <br>
                variable : type <br>
                To make TS variables act like JS variables, use the any type. 
                However, this isn't recommended, since there really isn't a point of using TS if the type system isn't used. <br>
                There is also the undefined and null types, which differ slightly.
                Undefined is automatically set, and is the default type of a variable after declaration.
                When something is of undefined type, it means there could be something in the variable later, it just isn't there yet.
                Null is manually set, and has a connotation with nothing being in the variable. 
                Both can be set to other types after.
                However, the difference between the two is so subtle, it's not that important.
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading">Functions</h2>
            <p>
                To create a function, use the function keyword, like: <br>
                function num(n : number, s : string) : string { <br>
                    &emsp;r : string = ""; <br>
                    &emsp;for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) { <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;r += s; <br>
                        &emsp;} <br>
                    &emsp;return s; <br>
                } <br>
                The arguments for the function use the same name : type syntax from before. 
                The return type is after the arguments, with a similar syntax, : type. <br>

                Overloading in TS is not as simple as in another language, like Java.
                There are two signatures, the overload signatures and the implementation signature.
