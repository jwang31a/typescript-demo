const keyword: const is a type of variable, cannot be reassigned, useful for constants (things that will not change)
var keyword: declares variable

if you want to see what actually gets run, you can still look at the .js file, since it's just normal javascript

JS is scripting language for web dev, TS can be used for that, but feels more like programming language like Java
in JS, it's possible to reassign something already with a type to another type, like reassigning a number to a string
TS doesn't allow this, but still allows for other JS quirks, like adding strings to numbers
